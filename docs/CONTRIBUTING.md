# Contributing to IntermCLI


# Contributing to IntermCLI

We welcome contributions‚Äînew tools, features, bug fixes, and docs!

## Quick Contribution Guide
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Add your tool in `tools/` with its own README and config
4. Add your tool to `tools_manifest.toml`
5. Test with both minimal and enhanced dependencies
6. Submit a PR with a clear description

## Tool Guidelines
- Use `action-target` naming (e.g., `scan-ports`, `find-projects`)
- Each tool should be self-contained, with its own config and README
- Use TOML for all config files
- Progressive enhancement: stdlib core, optional enhancements

## Testing
- Test with stdlib only and with all optional dependencies
- Include unit and integration tests
- Test on Python 3.9+
- Use `pytest` and tools from `requirements-dev.txt`


## Code Style & Pre-commit Hooks
- Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting
- Use [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting
- Pre-commit hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and run automatically before each commit:
    - Formatting: black, isort
    - Linting: ruff
    - Whitespace, YAML, merge conflict, shebang, docstring, and secret checks
    - To enable: run `pre-commit install` after cloning
    - To run manually: `pre-commit run --all-files`
    - To update hooks: `pre-commit autoupdate`


## PR Workflow
- All changes should be submitted via pull request
- PRs must pass CI (lint, tests, audit, pre-commit)
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions


## Branching & Releases
- Main development happens on `main` branch
- Use feature branches for new tools/features
- Releases are tagged and changelog is updated automatically

---

- Type annotations are encouraged (use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/))
- Keep code readable and modular
## Security & Quality
- Pre-commit hooks include checks to prevent committing secrets and merge conflicts
- Use [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) for automated dependency updates
- Add a `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting (recommended)
## Automation & Makefile
- Consider adding a `Makefile` or `tasks.py` for common dev tasks (lint, test, format, docs)
## Additional Tips
- Run `pre-commit autoupdate` regularly to keep hooks up to date
- Use `pre-commit run --all-files` before submitting a PR to catch issues early

## üìö Documentation

- Update the tool-specific README in `tools/{tool-name}/README.md`
- Add usage examples and configuration samples
- Update suite-level documentation if your change affects the overall system
- If you add a new tool, update `tools_manifest.toml` and the main README

## üå≥ Branching Model

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features (e.g., `feature/scan-ports-enhancement`)
- **tool/**: Major tool-specific changes (e.g., `tool/find-projects`)
- **release/**: Release preparation (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`)

---

## üè∑Ô∏è Semantic Versioning

- `v1.0.0`    Major: Breaking changes, new tool additions
- `v1.1.0`    Minor: New features, non-breaking changes
- `v1.1.1`    Patch: Bug fixes, documentation updates

---

## üöÄ Release Process

1. Create release branch: `git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Update version numbers in relevant files
4. Update `tools_manifest.toml` and configuration docs if needed
5. Test thoroughly (all supported Python versions)
6. Merge to `main`
7. Create GitHub release with binaries (if applicable)
8. Merge back to `develop`
