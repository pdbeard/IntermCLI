# Contributing to IntermCLI

We welcome contributions—new tools, features, bug fixes, and docs!

## Quick Contribution Guide
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`
3. Add your tool in `tools/` with its own README and config
4. Add your tool to `tools_manifest.toml`
5. Test with both minimal and enhanced dependencies
6. Submit a PR with a clear description

## Tool Guidelines
- Use `action-target` naming (e.g., `scan-ports`, `find-projects`)
- Each tool should be self-contained, with its own config and README
- Use TOML for all config files
- Progressive enhancement: stdlib core, optional enhancements

## Testing
- Test with stdlib only and with all optional dependencies
- Include unit and integration tests
- Test on Python 3.9+
- Use `pytest` and tools from `requirements-dev.txt`

## Code Style
- Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black) for formatting
- Use [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for import sorting

## PR Workflow
- All changes should be submitted via pull request
- PRs must pass CI (lint, tests, audit)
- Write clear commit messages and PR descriptions

## Branching & Releases
- Main development happens on `main` branch
- Use feature branches for new tools/features
- Releases are tagged and changelog is updated automatically

---
- Run [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting
- Type annotations are encouraged (use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/))
- Keep code readable and modular

---

## 📚 Documentation

- Update the tool-specific README in `tools/{tool-name}/README.md`
- Add usage examples and configuration samples
- Update suite-level documentation if your change affects the overall system
- If you add a new tool, update `tools_manifest.toml` and the main README

---

## 🌳 Branching Model

- **main**: Production-ready code
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/**: New features (e.g., `feature/scan-ports-enhancement`)
- **tool/**: Major tool-specific changes (e.g., `tool/find-projects`)
- **release/**: Release preparation (e.g., `release/v1.0.0`)

---

## 🏷️ Semantic Versioning

- `v1.1.0`    Minor: New features, non-breaking changes
- `v1.1.1`    Patch: Bug fixes, documentation updates

---

## 🚀 Release Process

1. Create release branch: `git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Update version numbers in relevant files
4. Update `tools_manifest.toml` and configuration docs if needed
5. Test thoroughly (all supported Python versions)
6. Merge to `main`
