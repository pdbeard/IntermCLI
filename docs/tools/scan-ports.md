## üìù Features

- **Fast multi-threaded scanning** (configurable thread count)
- **Configurable port lists** via TOML (`~/.config/intermcli/scan-ports.toml` or tool config)
- **Scan all lists at once** with `--list all`
- **Service detection**:
  - Basic (stdlib only)
  - Enhanced (with `requests`, `urllib3`, etc.)
- **HTTP/HTTPS detection**: banner, server, title, framework
- **Database and SSH detection**: version and banner grabbing
- **Scriptable output** (plain text, JSON planned)
- **Graceful error handling** and clear feedback
- **Optional TUI mode** (planned, with `rich`/`textual`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

You can customize port lists, timeouts, and detection settings in:

- `~/.config/intermcli/scan-ports.toml`
- Project-specific `.intermcli.toml`
- Tool directory: `tools/scan-ports/config/ports.toml`

**Example config:**
```toml
[port_lists.web]
description = "Web ports"
ports = { "80" = "HTTP", "443" = "HTTPS", "8080" = "HTTP Alt", "8443" = "HTTPS Alt" }

[port_lists.database]
description = "Database ports"
ports = { "5432" = "PostgreSQL", "3306" = "MySQL", "6379" = "Redis" }

[service_detection]
connection_timeout = 2
enhanced_detection = true
```

---

## üîó Integration with IntermCLI Suite

- **Consistent configuration:** All IntermCLI tools use TOML for configuration, supporting both global and tool-specific settings.
- **Composable workflows:** Output from `scan-ports` can be piped or integrated with other IntermCLI tools for automation and reporting.
- **Unified UX:** Shared conventions for options, output, and error handling across the suite.

---

## üîí Security Notes

- Only scan hosts/networks you own or have permission to test.
- Excessive scanning may trigger firewalls or IDS/IPS alerts.

---

## üß© Enhanced Features

If you have `requests`, `urllib3`, or other optional dependencies installed, you get:

- Enhanced HTTP/HTTPS detection (framework, server, redirects)
- Database version detection
- SSL/TLS certificate info (planned)
- Rich, colorized output (with `rich`)
- Interactive TUI mode (with `textual`, planned)

---

## üêç Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- No dependencies required for basic usage
- Optional: `requests`, `urllib3`, `rich`, `textual`, `tomli` (for Python <3.11)

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **No results?** Check network/firewall settings and host reachability.
- **Permission denied?** Try running with elevated privileges for some ports.
- **Slow scans?** Increase timeout or scan fewer ports at a time.
- **TOML errors?** Install `tomli` if using Python <3.11.

Happy scanning!
