# 🎯 IntermCLI Design Goals Document

## Project Overview
- **Repository**: intermcli
- **Command**: interm
- **Tagline**: "Interactive terminal utilities for developers"

## 🎨 Core Design Philosophy

### Interactive First
- Tools should engage with users, not just execute silently
- Provide helpful prompts, confirmations, and guidance
- Use colors, emojis, and clear formatting for better UX
- Offer both interactive and non-interactive modes

### Terminal Native
- Built for command-line workflows
- Respect terminal conventions and standards
- Work seamlessly with pipes, redirects, and scripting
- Fast startup times for responsive interaction

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality works with Python standard library only
- Optional dependencies unlock enhanced features
- Graceful degradation when dependencies unavailable
- Clear feedback about available/missing features

## 🎯 Design Goals

### 1. Zero Friction Installation
- Single command installation
- No complex dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Self-contained operation

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Required**: Python 3.6+ only
- **Optional**: requests, urllib3, rich, click
- **Fallbacks**: Always provide basic functionality
- **Detection**: Show what's available/missing

### 3. Interactive Design Patterns
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show information as needed
- **Smart Defaults**: Sensible defaults that work for 80% of use cases
- **Easy Override**: Easy to override when needed
- **User Preferences**: Remember user preferences where appropriate
- **Helpful Feedback**: Clear status messages and error handling

### 4. Composable Architecture
- Each tool should work independently
- Tools should work well together
- Support for piping and chaining operations
- Consistent interface patterns

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Core Standards
- Python 3.6+ compatibility
- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, WSL)
- No external binary dependencies
- UTF-8 output with emoji support

### Optional Enhancements
- Rich text formatting with `rich`
- Enhanced HTTP with `requests`
- Better CLI parsing with `click`
- Advanced terminal features when available

### Performance Targets
- Sub-100ms startup time for core commands
- Responsive interactive elements
- Efficient resource usage
- Graceful handling of large datasets

## 🎨 User Experience Guidelines

### Output Design
