# Documentation Updates

## How to Document Changes

When making significant changes to the codebase, please update this file to help other contributors understand the project. Documentation updates should include:

1. A description of the changes made
2. Which tools or components were affected
3. Any new patterns or conventions introduced
4. Any deprecated patterns or conventions

This helps maintain consistency across the project and ensures that all contributors are aware of the current best practices.
