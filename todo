- Add naming convention

### 2. Action-Target Naming Convention

All tools follow the `action-target` pattern for consistency and discoverability:

**Current Tools:**
- `scan-ports` - Scans network ports for services
- `find-projects` - Finds and navigates development projects

**Future Tool Examples:**
- `check-services` - Enhanced service detection and analysis
- `list-processes` - Process monitoring and management
- `monitor-network` - Network traffic monitoring
- `manage-configs` - Configuration file management
- `analyze-logs` - Log file analysis and filtering

**Benefits of Action-Target Pattern:**
- **Self-documenting**: Command name clearly indicates function
- **Tab-completable**: Easy discovery with shell completion
- **Consistent**: All tools follow same `verb-noun` structure
- **Professional**: Matches established CLI patterns
